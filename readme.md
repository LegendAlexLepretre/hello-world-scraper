# Introduction
Help! We don't know how to write a "Hello World!" program however we know how to scrape pages. ðŸ˜±

That's where our genius kicked in. ðŸ¤¯

Because we don't know how to print Hello World, we rely on that fantastic website that has Hello Worlds in hundreds of programming languages: http://helloworldcollection.de/

Our scraper then navigates the DOM to find the Hello World code that's relevant for Python 3

Once the code is extracted, a simple `eval()` executes the remote code and prints **Hello World**

... which we then **PACKAGED IN A FLASK API**
